# EMS3D: Respond & Rescue (Single Player)

This repository contains the single player version of EMS3D: Respond & Rescue, a training simulator used to help train paramedics. This specific build only trains paramedics and players cannot choose to play as the incident commander.

EMS3D is an ambitious and potentially high-impact project involving Singaporeâ€™s emergency medical  services, utilising hospital and emergency medical datasets, and modelling patient events and  optimizing patient care activities. The EMS3D is part of the Virtual Singapore project developed at Nanyang Technological Institute and developed in collaboration with Singapore General Hospital and Singapore Self Defense Forces.
